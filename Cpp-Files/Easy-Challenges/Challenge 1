create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:
your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)
for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  string name, ageValue, username;
  int age;
  
  cout << "What is your name?" << endl;
  getline(cin, name);
  cout << "How old are you?" << endl;
  getline(cin, ageValue);
  age = stoi(ageValue);
  cout << "What is your reddit username?" << endl;
  getline(cin, username);
  
  cout << "Your name is " << name << ", you are " << age << ", and your username is " << username;
  
  return 0;
